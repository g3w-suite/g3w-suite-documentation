# QGIS: project settings

_**This section describes how to optimize your QGIS projects to publish as a WebGis service.**_

Thanks to the integration with QGIS Server, all the symbology aspects associated with the singoly layers are automatically reproduced on the WebGis service

In the QGIS cartographic projects you can set some parameters and options that affect functionalities and contents in the derivative WebGis service, such as:
* the **webgis service identification name**
* the associated **basic metadata**
* the **capabilities of the service**
* the possibility to **exclude some associated print layouts** on the WebGis service
* which layers are **queryable and searchable**
* which layers to expose with the different **OGC services (WMTS, WFS, WCS)**
* which **fields** (for each vector data) are exposed as WMS and/or WFS
* the **Themes (Views)** defined at the project level
* layer/group management from **embedded projects**
* the **structure of the query form** visible on the WebGis service
* the **editing widget**, **constraints** and **default values** (also based on QGIS expressions) for every fields of vector layers
* the associated **print layouts, report included**

The following paragraphs describe which QGIS project settings are more relevant in relation to the published WebGis service.

## Project property
From the **`Project → Properties`** menu, you can access the **`Project Properties`** window and the three submenus of our interest:
 * **General**
 * **Data sources**
 * **QGIS server**

### General
#### General Settings
**In this section it is possible to define the title of the project, consequently the `title of the WebGis service`.**

This title will be used at the G3W-SUITE application level to uniquely identify the published project; for this reason **it will not be possible to assign the same name to different projects published on the WebGis service**.

**We advise against using special characters, or numbers in the project name.**

### Data sources

The option **`Automatically create transaction group where possible`** is automatically inherited in the online editing function.

#### Layers Capabilities

**This submenu defines the **querable and/or searchable layers** at the WebGis service level.**
 * Check the **`Identifiable`** column if you want that the layer will be searchable on the WebGis
 * Check the **`Searchable`** column if you want that the layer will be querable on the WebGis
 

**NB: this differentiation is only possible by using the QGIS APIs such as Search URL endpoint.**
See [dedicated paragraph](https://g3w-suite.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.x/settings.html#g3w-client-search-endpoint)


![](images/manual/datasources.png)

### QGIS Server

##### Service capabilities
**In this section it is possible to define the `capabilities of the service`**.

This information, together with info about the structure of the attribute tables of the layers present in the project, will be displayed in the **Metadata session** of the cartographic client.

See also [dedicated paragraph](https://g3w-suite.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.x/g3wsuite_client.html#metadata)

![](images/manual/qgisservercapabilities.png)

##### Capabilities WMS - Advertised extent
**In this section it is possible to define the `geographical extension` displayed when the WebGis service starts.**

To define it, set the desired geographical view on the map and then click on the **'Use Current Canvas Extent'** button.

![](images/manual/qgisserversetmapexpetent.png)

##### WMS Capabilities - CSR restrictions
**In this section it is possible to define the `projection systems` for which the project is available in relation to `OGC services`.**

It is clearly necessary to insert the projection system on which the project was made, this SR is added by clicking on the **'Used'** button.

Other geographic reference systems can be implemented by clicking on the **'+'** button and choosing from the list of reference systems.

![](images/manual/qgisserversrisrestriction.png)

##### Capabilities WMS - Exclude layouts
**In this section it is possible to `exclude some of the print layouts` that are associated with the cartographic project from the availability of the WebGis service.**

![](images/manual/qgisserverexludecompositions.png)

##### Capabilities WMS - General aspects
Two further aspects are manageable with regard to WMS capabilities
 * in general it is recommended to check **`use the layer ids as names`** option
 * the option **`Add geometry to feature response`** must be checked to activate the **zoom to the features** on the WebGis service

![](images/manual/qgisservergeneralaspects.png)

##### WMTS Capabilities
**In this section it is possible to define which `layers are exposed as WMTS services` defining the various options**

##### WFS Capabilities
**In this section it is possible to define which `layers are exposed as WFS services`.**

The WFS service is needed if you want activate following types of query:
 * **Query by bbox**
 * **Query by polygon** (rectangle/square)
 * **Query by draw polygon**

It is sufficient to check only the **`Published`** column

 ![](images/manual/qgisservergeneralaspectswfs.png)
 
 ##### WCS Capabilities
**In this section it is possible to define which `rasters are exposed as WCS services`**


## General aspects

### Themes (Views)

The creation of **Themes** (combination of off / on layers and differentiated symbology styles) is managed at the WebGis service level.

A specific menu on the webgis will allow you to choose the Theme to be displayed.

The views will be parameterizable at the URL level of the related webgis service.

### Layer order

The option to define the layer order different from the order in the TOC on the QGIS project is automatically supported.

### Legend

The activation of the **`Filter legend by Map content`** option on the QGIS project is automatically applied to the derived WebGis service.

If the **`Show features count`** function is activated in the QGIS project at vector layer level, the same information will be displayed on the web map.

The number of features updates automatically based on the style associated with the layer.

### Spatial Bookmarks

In case **`Spatial Bookmarks`** are saved at the QGIS project level, they will also be available on the web map.

### Mutually exclusive groups

The activation on the QGIS project of the **`Mutually exclusive group`** option for the layers groups is automatically applied to the derived WebGis service.

### 1:N and N:M relations

The interface inherits the 1: and N:M relations defined in the **`Project Properties`** from the QGIS project.

The suite also manages **relations based on multiple keys**.

**ATTENTION:** to correctly manage these types of relations it is NECESSARY to insert the reference to the relations in the customized form

![](images/manual/qgislayerproperties_displayform_relations.png)


### Embedded project
**It is possible to publish QGIS projects that contain layers or groups of layers deriving from embedded projects.**
It is clearly necessary to publish the embedded project first and then those derived from it.
An update of the embedded project will result in a consequent modification of all derived projects.
The request to delete the basic embedded project causes a warning message as this operation will cause problems on all derived projects.

## Layers properties

### Simbology
The rendering style associated with the individual layers is replicated autonomously on the WebGis service.

The suite allows the switching on/off of the individual categories linked to the various simbolgy methods (categorized, graduated, by rules …).

![](images/manual/g3wsuite_simbology_onoff.png)

If external SVG icons are used (added to the basic ones of QGIS, via the **`Settings -> Options -> System -> SVG paths`**), these must be uploaded to the server (through the **`File Manager`** tool) in order to be used by QGIS Server.

#### Manage custom SVG icons
In the installation procedure of the G3W-SUITE application, an **`svg`** named directory is created on the server.

Within this directory it is therefore possible to store SVG icons, also organized in subdirecory.

The **`Configurations icon`** ![](images/manual/iconconfiguration.png), located in the upper right corner of the **Administration Panel**, allows you to access a menu that includes the **`File Manager`** item.

![](images/manual/g3wclient_icon_config.png)

![](images/manual/g3wsuite_administration_configuration_menu.png)

Through this tool it is possible to manage SVG icons on the server in a simple and intuitive way.

![](images/manual/g3wsuite_administration_file_manager.png)

The SVG folder on the server must reflect the structure in any subfolders present locally.

**NB:** The name of this directory is defined by the basic settings set during the installation of the suite.
[See dedicated paragraph.](https://g3w-suite.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.x/settings.html#base-settings)

**PS:** remember that the **`File Manager`** tool also allows you to manage the synchronization of geographical data (in the case of using physical files) and the management of multimedia files.

See also [dedicated paragraph](https://g3w-suite.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.x/projectsettings.html#viewing-multimedia-content)



### Multi-style layer
**The suite manages the presence of multiple styles associated with a layer.**

It will be possible to dynamically choose the style on the cartographic client.

It will be possible to manage the styles associated with a layer from the Administration component, also by **loading .qml file styles** and **setting the default style** among those present.



### Definition of the fields that can be consulted for each layer
Within the QGIS project it is also possible to define, for each layer, which fields are available following query on the WebGis service.

To define these settings, you access the properties of one of the vectors previously defined as searchable and choose the **`Source Fields`** submenu in the **`Layer Properties`** window.

This submenu lists the fields associated to the table of the vector.

The check box relating to the **`WMS`** column defines whether the values contained in this field will be available following the query on the WebGis service.

 ![](images/manual/qgislayerproperties_wmsfields.png)


### Definition of the attribute display form
For each layer it is possible to define the structure of the attributes form associated with displaying the results following query operations.

On QGIS, we can build a personalized form (query form) by creating thematic tabs and groups and defining the distribution of the individual fields and their aliases.

This structural organization will be replicated directly on the query form on the WebGis service.

The current version of QGIS also handles conditional forms and cascade drill-downs

### Layer basic information

If you set a descriptive information in the **`Abstract`** form of the **`QGIS Server`** session of the **`Layer Properties`**, this information will be associated with the layer at the webgis level.


### Temporal settings

This functionality is only available using QGIS Server >= 3.26

The Temporal Controller functions in QGIS are replicated on the webgis component

Time series functionality works on both vector and raster data, even in multi-layer mode.

Time setting on vector data is limited to the **`Single Field with Date/Time`** case

![](images/manual/qgislayerproperties_displayform_relations.png)



#### Viewing multimedia content
Multimedia contents (images, pdf, web URL ...) can be viewed interactively on the map client following publication of the QGIS project.

In the case of web links, simply insert them (preceded by the prefix **`http://`** or **`https://`**) within the dedicated attribute fields

In the case of multimedia files it is necessary:
 * **upload the media file to the `media_user` folder** (folder exposed on the web) accessible through the **`File Manager`** tool in the Suite Administration Panel
 * **insert the web link to this file in the dedicated attribute field**

The link to the file can be obtained in the following way:
 * **`application domain + media_user + path of the file + file name`**

Example:
 * application domain: **`https://dev.g3wsuite.it`**
 * file **`file_A.pdf`** located in the folder **`/media_user/form/`**
 * web link: **`https://dev.g3wsuite.it/media_user/form/file_A.pdf`**

Following queries at the cartographic client level, we will have different behaviors based on the type of content:
 * **image**: preview display in the form, click on the preview to display the image in real size
 * **web link or other multimedia file**: display of an **Open** orange button to allow consultation of the content

 ![](images/manual/qgis_form_attribute.png)

## Print layouts
Any print layouts associated with the published QGIS project will automatically be associated with the published WebGis service.

**Print layouts can contain more than one `Map` items and panoramic maps.**

You can set also a **custom title** (definible in the WebGis side) setting an **Item ID** at a **Label** item.

**Atlas and report are also supported.**

Any images present in the print layouts must be placed in the local **`project_data`** folder (in any subdirectory) and synchronized on the server.

See also the dedicated paragraph [Geographic data synchronization on the server](https://g3w-suite.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6.x/datamanagement.html#geographic-data-synchronization-on-the-server).

## Performances optimization

### Mandatory rules

* PostGreSQL/PostGis, SQLite/Spatialite and GeoPKG layers must have a **primary key**
* the primary key field and all fields involved in search, join, 1:n or N:M relations or editing function have to be **published as WMS**
* **don't use commas for aliases** associated with layers
* style settings defined at the auxiliary data level are not supported

### Tips
* when using rule-based/categorized classification **create indexes on the column(s) involved** in the rule expression
* start the project with **only a few layers turned on** by default
* do not exceed three nesting levels in the groups of layers defined in the TOC
